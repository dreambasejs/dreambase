/**
 * Generates a valid version 4 UUID but replacing bytes 0-6 with a timestampish value
 * instead of random, similary to UUID version 1 but with random istead of MAC address.
 *
 * With "timestampish" we mean milliseconds from 1970 approximately, as in bulk-creation
 * scenarios, milliseconds in future will be used (while creating more than 1 id per
 * millisecond)
 *
 * This is similary UUID version 1 but with random instead of Mac, and with
 * support for generating unique IDs the same millisecond.
 *
 * It's even more similar to the "version 6" proposal at
 * https://bradleypeabody.github.io/uuidv6/.
 *
 * Difference from "version 6" proposal is that we keep the clock-sequence within
 * the timestamp part to allow 9 more bits for randomness. This is at the cost of
 * knwoing how exact the time-stamp is. But since we anyway don't expect a perfect
 * time stamps as many clients may have wrong time settings, what we want is just
 * a sorted ID, still universially unique.
 *
 * Random part is totally 73 bits entropy, which basically means that a collisions would
 * be likely if 9 444 732 965 739 290 427 392 devices was generating ids during the exact same
 * millisecond.
